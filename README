Please Note:
This is a fork of the original satchmo-bank-transfer by aronchi (http://github.com/aronchi/satchmo-bank-transfer).
His version does not seem to work with Satchmo 0.9.2 so I did some minor adaptions to get it to work.

### How it works

It sends an email with your store bank IBAN and SWIFT code to the customer.


### Installation:

1) Copy the source to your project_dir/store/bank_transfer/

2) add the module to your SATCHMO_SETTINGS: 'CUSTOM_PAYMENT_MODULES' : ('store.bank_transfer',), (this is probably not needed anymore?)
   add the module in your INSTALLED_APPS

3) Configure it in your http://www.store.com/settings

4) Change the email template "order_complete.txt" to add your data
   Add a templates/checkout/order_complete.html to display order information
   You can use the new bank_info template tag display the IBAN/SWIFT Numbers like this:

   <template snippet>
   {% load config_get %}
   {% bank_info for order as pinfo %}
   {% trans "Account Owner" %}: {{ pinfo.OWNER }}
   {% trans "IBAN" %}: {{ pinfo.IBAN }}
   {% trans "SWIFT" %}: {{ pinfo.SWIFT }}
   </template snippet>
